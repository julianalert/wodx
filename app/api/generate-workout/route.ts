The program must be logic based on previous workouts and rest days, so today's workout should be influenced by the previous days. 
However, do NOT follow a predictable pattern. Be creative and surprisingâ€”introduce new movements, formats, or challenges. Avoid repeating the same structure or exercises as previous days. 
If a rest day is needed, make it a rest day. Workouts must be mostly inspired by crossfit workouts and exercises.
